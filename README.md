# pbprefs-rs
Rust preference crate

Made with rust 1.75.0

The idea of this crate is to create a make a library that can handle configuration loaded/saved to a file but edited/reloaded at runtime. Initially (and probably permenantely) I am making it as simple as possible and in any case of preference I am choosing my own.
